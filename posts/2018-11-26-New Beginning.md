Hello, and welcome to my magical data driven journey. I am switching gears and looking to dive into a new career of data science. So come along and enjoy the scenery as I learn and work on many new projects. 

### Life Experiences
I Have spend much of my working life doing jobs to help people understand and learn different concepts and ideas. I have done retail sales, customer service, software testing and support as well as help desk roles. I have always enjoyed working with people but data has always been a passion and I am finally finding my way to a data driven profession. 

### Life Learning
I am completing my Bachelor's of Science degree in Data Analytics in December 2018 and that has help me prepare for a different type of business role than I am used to but am excited to get started in. I am also learning more practical applications of data science and the respective tools used by data scientists to enrich business decisions. I look forward to working along other data professionals in driving business initiatives that help make the world a better place.
